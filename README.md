## Duration
* 20th Sep 2021 â€“ 8th Oct 2021

## Proxy
* We are using Smartproxy. Australian residential proxies in Smartproxy should begin from port 30001. Each port has thousands of residential IP addresses and more, but will rotate proxies for every connection. So in order to make sure we use a new IP address to visit the product every time, we will change port every time.

## Note
* Please see detailed instruction in the report.
